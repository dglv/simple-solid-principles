## SOLID Principles

### Single Responsibility (SRP)

Each class should have only one sole purpose, and not be filled with excessive functionality.

### Open Closed (OCP)

Classes should be open for extension, closed for modification. In other words, you should not have to rewrite an
existing class for implementing new features.

### Liskov Substitution (LSP)

This means that every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class.

### Interface Segregation (ISP)

Interfaces should not force classes to implement what they can't do. Large interfaces should be divided into small ones.

### Dependency Inversion (DIP)

Components should depend on abstractions, not on concretions.
